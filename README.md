## A Simple Card Deck Generator, Written in Rust

This simple Rust binary generates a data structure for a standard 52-card playing deck. It then randomly shuffles the deck and draws two cards (You vs. CPU). Whoever has the highest card wins. If both cards are of the same value, the highest suit wins based on English alphabetical order (lowest to highest: ♣, ♢, ♡, ♠).
